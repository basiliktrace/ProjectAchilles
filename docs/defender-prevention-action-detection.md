# Spec: Defender prevention-action detection (vendor-confirmed prevented)

**Status:** approved · **Applies to:** Microsoft Defender integration (both backends + frontend)
**Related:** `docs/edr-prevention-action-detection.md` (CrowdStrike original), `docs/edr-killed-stage-detection.md`
**Canonical reference:** `wiki/docs/user-guide/analytics/exit-codes-and-outcomes.md`

## Problem

CrowdStrike stages killed by Falcon are already reclassified as **Prevented** using the alert's
`pattern_disposition`. Defender has a direct equivalent we don't use: every item in a Graph
`alerts_v2` alert's `evidence[]` carries `remediationStatus`
(`microsoft.graph.security.evidenceRemediationStatus`):

| Defender value | Microsoft's definition | Normalized `prevention_action` |
|---|---|---|
| `blocked` | "The threat was blocked **while executing**" | `process_killed` |
| `prevented` | "The threat was **prevented from executing**" | `blocked` |
| `remediated` | "Remediation action has **completed** successfully" | `quarantined` |
| `active` / `running` / `pendingApproval` / `none` / `notFound` / `unremediated` / `declined` / `partiallyRemediated` | no completed prevention | *(absent)* |

Without it, a stage Defender killed mid-flight lands as exit 999 and gets at most **Detected**,
when the vendor deterministically reported prevention. (Defender already gets prevention credit
for 105/126/127 exit codes; this fills the mid-flight-kill gap — exactly the gap closed for
CrowdStrike in PR #486/#487.)

## Change (Defender only; mirrors the CrowdStrike design)

1. **Sync (`transformAlert`, both backends)** — derive alert-level prevention from
   `evidence[].remediationStatus`:
   - Consider only evidence items that carry a filename/path (process/file evidence — the ones
     `transformAlert` already extracts into `evidence_filenames`/`evidence_filepaths`); if none
     have a status, fall back to any evidence item with a prevention-ish status.
   - Alert-level value = strongest completed action, precedence `remediated` > `blocked` >
     `prevented`; normalize per the table above into `prevention_action`, and keep the raw
     Defender value in `remediation_status` (keyword) for audit/display.
   - Also capture `portal_url` ← the alert's `alertWebUrl` (Graph provides a per-alert deep link —
     upgrades the Defender drawer from the generic portal base, same as `falcon_host_link` did).
   - `remediationStatus` evolves over time (`active` → `remediated`), and alert re-syncs via
     `updatedDateTime` upserts naturally refine it; still bump `ALERT_SYNC_VERSION` 3 → 4 to
     backfill existing alert docs immediately.
   - Index mappings updated additively (both backends + `scripts/upload_to_elasticsearch.py`).

2. **Enrichment (both Defender enrichment services)** — identical rule to CrowdStrike:
   stage-binary matches always qualify; bundle-wide matches qualify only when the stage never
   reached a conclusive outcome (`event.ERROR` ∉ {101, 105, 126, 127}). Qualifying matches set
   `f0rtika.defender_prevented: true` + `f0rtika.defender_prevention_action: '<action>'`.
   `msearch` sub-queries include `_source: ['prevention_action']`.
   Results-index mapping gains the two additive fields (both backends + python script).

3. **Types / roll-up (both backends)** — `types/analytics.ts`:
   `defender_prevented?` / `defender_prevention_action?` on the execution type,
   `defenderPrevented?` on the group badge; carried through `elasticsearch.ts` roll-up and
   `mapHitToExecution` exactly like the CrowdStrike fields.

4. **Scoring** — no formula change (prevented ⊆ detected; the combined Defense Score already
   counts detected as protected). SB report: `mapOutcome` treats `defender_prevented` like
   `crowdstrike_prevented` (PREVENTED except conclusive-executed 101), and `preventedBy` lists
   the preventing vendor(s) — both when both apply.

5. **Frontend** —
   - `ExecResultLabel` / `BundleResultLabel`: **Prevented** when either vendor's prevented flag
     is set (or detected + confirmed prevention action); the action label mapping is already
     normalized and shared (`crowdstrikePrevention.ts` — rename/generalize to a vendor-neutral
     prevention util).
   - Defender `AlertDetailsDrawer` + Defender sections in `RunDetailPanel`: prevention badge
     (same component as CrowdStrike) and per-alert `portal_url` deep links with the existing
     `security.microsoft.com/alerts` fallback.

## Rollout

Additive mappings only. `ALERT_SYNC_VERSION` bump re-fetches 90 days of alerts with remediation
status; the next enrichment pass backfills `defender_prevented` on eligible docs (docs with both
detected flags set are not re-scanned — same one-time `update_by_query` pattern used for the
CrowdStrike backfill may be applied operationally where needed).

## Tests

- transformAlert: normalization table (each status → action), precedence across multiple evidence
  items, filename-evidence preference, absent when detection-only, `portal_url` capture, version
  bump forces full re-sync.
- Enrichment (both backends): stage match + `blocked` → `defender_prevented`; wide match on a
  101-coded doc → no prevented flag; wide match on 999 doc → qualifies.
- SB report: 999 + `defender_prevented` → PREVENTED with `preventedBy: ['Microsoft Defender for
  Endpoint']`; both vendors prevented → both listed; 101 + flag → DETECTED (guard).
- Frontend: Prevented label for either vendor; drawer `portal_url` preferred, fallback preserved.
